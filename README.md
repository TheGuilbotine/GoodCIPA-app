</p>

- All pages have a footer with links to the creators GitHub and Linkedin account.

- Profile Page allows users to enter the Beer Cave to browse, add new beers, edit ones they have added, and crack open to review any beer in the cave.
Or go to the fridge to see a list of beers reviewed by other users. Users can click on each beer and eventually will be able to see all of the reviews for that beer and who said it.

## Challenges
- There are a few bugs to work out brining in information to each page. Data such as users who wrote comments etc, has been difficult to pull into the individual IPA pages.
- Some rerenders were diffiuct to implement smoothly, but eventually were mastered.
