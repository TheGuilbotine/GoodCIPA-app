# GoodCIPA by Pierre Guilbault

### The IPA enthusiasts app. A cave of IPAs that can be added to and browsed to find new beers to open, try, and review.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- REACT
- REDUX
- PostgreSQL
- Hosted on Heroku

## Brief Site Walkthrough
- Splash page allows users to access login, register, or use a Demo account to check out the app.
- All pages have a footer with links to the creators GitHub and Linkedin account.
- Profile Page allows users to enter the Beer Cave to browse, add new beers, edit ones they have added, and crack open to review any beer in the cave.
Or go to the fridge to see a list of beers reviewed by other users. Users can click on each beer and eventually will be able to see all of the reviews for that beer and who said it.
- From the Add or Edit beer form users will be able to dynamically add, edit, and deltete beers.
- The Crack Open fomr will allow users to review/leave a comment about the beer they have tried.

## Challenges
- There are a few bugs to work out brining in information to each page. Data such as users who wrote comments etc, has been difficult to pull into the individual IPA pages.
- Some rerenders were diffiuct to implement smoothly, but eventually were mastered.
